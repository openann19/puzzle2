- **Password**: eb3efb5151e6255994711fe8f2264427ceeebf88109e1d7fad5b0a8b6d07e5bf (SHA256 of "causality")
- **Method**: AES-256-CBC with SHA256, embedded salt
- **Content**: 7-part password construction puzzle clues

### 📝 Decrypted Phase 2 Clues:
```
The ironic 2name of the keymakers trying to protect the current digital powers 
which are still in severe danger due to the keymaker's way of security by hiding, 
nearly unprotected, in plain sight. {eps3.4_[in one of the valleys of Phillip]
runtime-error.r00., where daughters hit magic keypads} When this fails.. 
Crypto finally to the latin 3Moon? Tell me, 4How so mate?

# X 2 S H 4 Y 0 Q B 15 #
Q -> extend the name of a hackers' swordless fish, the I and W are below.
B -> ((BV80605001911AP)- (sqrt(-1)))^2  
H -> (Answer to only this puzzle but nothing else) * -1
S -> cha' + (vagh * jav)
```

### 🧩 Puzzle Structure Analysis
Based on GitHub documentation, the 7-part password is:
1. **causality** ✅
2. **Safenet** ✅ (from "2name" clue - Thales Safenet HSM)
3. **Luna** ✅ (from "3Moon" clue - Luna HSM)  
4. **HSM** ✅ (from "4How so mate" clue)
5. **11110** ✅ (JFK Executive Order reference)
6. **0x736B6E616220726F662074756F6C69616220646E6F63657320666F206B6E697262206E6F20726F6C6C65636E61684320393030322F6E614A2F33302073656D695420656854** ✅ (Bitcoin genesis block hex)

### 🔐 Next Steps
1. Concatenate the 7 parts and SHA256 hash them
2. Use resulting hash to decrypt the next phase
3. Continue until we find the private key for the target address
